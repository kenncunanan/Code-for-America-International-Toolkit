## <font color="#399fd3">DESCRIPTION: THE CODE FOR AMERICA FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM</font color>

Code for America’s Fellowship Program is a  year of public service program in which civic-minded developers, designers, and product managers are selected and grouped into small startup teams. These teams are then paired with a local government partner for a year-long collaboration. Fellows work from the Code for America offices in San Francisco and each team of three fellows works to develop a solution that leverages technology facing its U.S. city partner.

Fellows and government staff from the fellowship team’s city partner work together to build apps, foster new approaches to problem solving throughout City Hall, and tackle issues the community is facing. In the past, teams have worked on solving for access to social services, alternatives to incarceration, and new avenues for public input.

The fellowship is Code for America’s flagship program. It provides us at Code for America with key learnings about the inner workings of government and gives us the opportunity to iterate, try things out and then apply those learnings to our more scaled programs.
