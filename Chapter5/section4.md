One question we often get is - how do you frame the fellowship as worthwhile opportunity? How do you brand it as cool and worthy of sacrificing the big bucks that potential fellows would get from working in the tech world instead?

We recognize that these are very real challenges everyone in the network faces
in recruiting quality fellows. We’ve broken down our strategy into a few key parts.

**Generating buzz and klout around the organization**

* storytelling - reference your successes/wins and the success of partner organizations (check out city recruitment)


* events

**Framing the opportunity provided by participating**

*For what their giving, what are they getting?*

**2 pronged approach to pushing out the messaging**

When asked how to outreach to potential fellowship applicants, we recommend a two-pronged marketing approach, both at the high-level side (getting major news outlet in your local area to share about the program or stories of your work or launch) and the grassroots level. This allows for people both within and outside the network gain access to the opportunity.

**High level press**

No matter the size of the population of the community you’re serving, there are bound to be media outlets, TV stations, blogs, community gatherings, and listservs that would love to do a story about an event, launch, initiative, or campaign you are creating, relating to fellowship recruitment or not.

We typically start developing relations with both national and local press outlets to push our stories out. This involves creating something like a press release, sharing stories personally to local press and/or local thought leaders and celebrities who would be willing to share your message. This can be a slow process but don’t be discouraged!

**Grassroots**

Its incredibly powerful for us to leverage our email list to spread the word about our fellowship opportunity. Here at Code for America, we use Mailchimp to share the fellowship opportunity with our list of folks subscribed to our newsletter. Like any social change organization, we grew our list over time. As of June 2014, we have over 14.5k subscribers to our email list, but that didn’t overnight. Cultivating this list allows us to leverage our wider group of supporters helps us magnify our ability to recruit for the fellowship.

Here’s an example email we sent to our [followers on our email list](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1-3POEes1u3aLjKC0xflnd_k-HHnNrlWu53GyP_1pemE/edit).

Both of these strategies have been equally important to getting the word out about our fellowship opportunity. Depending on your community, the same may be true of your fellowship recruitment, or you may depend more on personal recommendations and relat
