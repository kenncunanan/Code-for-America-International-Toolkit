## <font color="#cf1b41">Team Formation</font color>

Code for America seeks a diverse fellowship class at both the team level and within the entire cohort. In a team, we typically try to treat the team like a very early stage startup in terms of skill needs. We typically need development talent (both backend, frontend, database skills, data science), design talent (user experience, graphic design, design thinking, etc.), and people skills (project management, product management, community engagement, content development, and more.)
We don’t need all of these talents in any single person, and overlap is highly beneficial. Within Code for America, we work very hard to foster a culture of collaboration (we’ll talk more about this later) within the cohort because no single team of 3 is guaranteed to have all the skills they need on their own to develop a totally finished product. We also make these selections with the understanding that we have support within Code for America to mentor and support these teams in developing their projects.

Some examples of the specific skills we select for can be found in this deck that we prepared for Code for Mexico City. You can also see a breakdown of data on where our total applicants come from and their skills in [this blog post](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/) that our marketing team put together.

This deck was used to prepare the fellows of Code for Mexico City to think about how they create their projects. It describes the different skillsets that their teams may have.  </div>
