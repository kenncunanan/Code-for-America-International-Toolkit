## <font color="#cf1b41">Strategies</font color>

At Code for America we deploy many different strategies to recruit. We face challenges sometimes similar to what you might face - paying fellows sub-market wages creates challenges in recruiting candidates away from their high-paying jobs in the tech sector; its often hard for candidates to relocate and uproot their lives for the fellowship experience, especially if they have families or community ties to a certain place; and the tech sector from place to place varies, so strategies in one area may not work in another. However, time and time again we are amazed at the quality of the candidates we accept and their ability to innovate in local government.

* **benefits we offer:** At the high level, Code for America provides access to the network of dedicated civic tech professionals and leaders that inspire our work and provide possible career connections into the future. We work to connect our fellows with leaders in civic startups, thought leaders like Tim O’Reilly, government leaders (2013 fellow Laura Meixell now [works as a data and strategy manager](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNTExPYXFSZmZad1E/edit) for the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.) and more.

* **logistical support:** We provide staff time supporting fellows’ relocation and pre-orientation. For those who have student loans, we offer loan deferment.

* **where we go to recruit:** Code for America is lucky to be located in San Francisco and be able to draw from Silicon Valley for candidates. However, we have to leverage regional networks to attract tech talent from all corners of Code for America. Our top candidates, who typically both have the skills and the passion to make last contributions in our space, also typically come from referrals from within our existing network. This information guides our recruitment process.
