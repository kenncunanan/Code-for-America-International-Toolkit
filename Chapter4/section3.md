* **Government Residency:** Provides an opportunity for fellows to create relationships with government officials, conduct user research with citizens, develop partnerships with community nonprofits/startups and start identifying data sets that would be useful for the project.


* **Product Sprints & Mentorship:** When the fellows come back from Residency they will begin development of their first project prototype after whittling their ideas to a top few. This is when they really start using “lean” principles to build their work. Staff engages with the fellows at this time with recurring trainings, meetups, and 1-1s to continue supporting fellows. Fellows will also make plans to fly back to their government partners to pitch back their ideas to their stakeholders back home. This is also an important time for us to begin recruiting for the next fellowship class and continue selection of our government partners.


* **Mid-year Reports and Celebrations:** We require all fellowship teams to put together a mid year report on their project progress and metrics from the year. We also are planning a “Mini-Summit” conference by which we give the CfA community a snapshot view into what the fellows are working on so far.


* **Product Sprints & Career Development:** Fellows continue the development of their next stage prototypes and develop tests to increase the security and rigor of their app projects. Staff begins to support fellows with connections and ideas for what they may transition to post-fellowship. Fellows will continue to make plans to fly back to their government partners to get more feedback.


* **Code for America Summit:** [The Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXQb-yhqktQ) provides an engagement and storytelling mechanism for the civic tech movement, whereby fellows & their government partners are able to tell their stories to a broader audience. The Summit includes high level production value talks that also serve as marketing for our movement. Check out the [app demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCZV9CR4dQ) from our Louisville Kentucky Team.


* **Transition & Sustainability:** Code for America fellows and staff are working together throughout the entire year to develop and/or identify appropriate sustainability mechanisms within the government partner. October and November are used to focus on that transition, as well as have a celebration to close out the program. We also use this time to orient our new government partners.
