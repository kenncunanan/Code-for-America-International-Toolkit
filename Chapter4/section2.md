Code for Americaâ€™s fellowship team consists of two individuals, our Fellowship Program Director and our Fellowship Program Manager. Both are directly involved with and collaborate on shaping the calendar by which the programming of the fellowship are delivered, but the Program Manager focuses on overall delivery, creation, and evaluation, while the Program Director works with overall strategy and partnerships between programs and government partners.
