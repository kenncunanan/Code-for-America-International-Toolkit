[Luke](http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/luke-norris/) is CfA’s Director of Government Relations. He’s responsible for developing pipelines of city partners interested in collaborating with CfA’s Fellowship Program. Luke’s role is a key part of CfA’s Fellowship Program. He not only pitches the program to city partners but walks them through the process to enhance the potential for project success.

Anyone in Luke’s role should have both a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of city government and also be comfortable in a traditional sales background. Expansive knowledge of examples of innovation successes and how they benefit a city government and its residents to draw upon are also fundamental.

For example, before CfA Luke primarily worked in Business Development roles in tech organizations, focusing on on developing, prospecting, and negotiating deals and partnerships. This positioned him perfectly to interface with potential CfA Fellowship City Partners.
