## <font color="#cf1b41">Implementing the Program</font color>

This schedule is tailored for a program which centrally locates our fellows in one place (San Francisco), with around 4 visits to their government partner throughout the year (after their initial monthlong residency). This [Program Implementation Example](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AksxopTEkLVNdGdmUEZ5azNtOEt1YTNnRDFBT2NmOGc#gid=0) from the 2014 Code for America fellowship was created by our fellowship team as a way to organize what activities we do in each stage of the fellowship as described above.

This schedule may not work for many government partners where fellows may work alongside their governments all year long (of which, there are definitely many benefits.) In that case, your calendar may look more like:

1. Fellowship promotion, application and selection
2. Problem discovery - Information diagnosis and opening data: the fellows worked jointly with their government partners to determine the datasets they would need as inputs for their projects and subsequently took the necessary steps to make them available. For this stage, the fellows spent 2 weeks straight with their government partners (1 month)
3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Armed with an improved understanding of the problem they are trying to solve, the fellows then went on to develop an MVP which served as a very simple way to explain their idea and to test the viability of this technological solution with both lab staff and their respective government counterparts. This version was used to gain feedback from peers and was based on the idea of very short and tight feedback loops in which small changes would be made to adapt to the refined needs of the problem space. (2.5 months)

4. Product development: Refinement of the MVP that takes into account the feedback and recommendations of other fellows, lab staff and government counterparts. For this portion, the fellows focused their efforts on building out the technical components of their idea and on refining it from a graphic design and usability standpoint, making citizen usability and access of the highest priority. At the end of this phase the fellows had created a full-fledged beta version of their product. (2 months)

5. Testing: The fellows took their products out into the world so that real people and their key users could test their products, identify bugs, usability issues and make suggestions for improvement prior to the final hand-off of their product to their government counterpart.  (2 months)

6. App launch and transition to govt. partners

For example, partners who implemented the fellowship program in Mexico City utilized the above timeline.

As always, we encourage International partners to leverage our materials and processes in ways that best fits their needs.
