It is ideal to approach mayors when they have been recently elected. In our experience Mayors get excited about the program because they want innovation, and be known as trying to do “things differently” with a new policy agenda and use that to carry momentum for their term. Creating positive PR opportunities are helpful in getting mayors and other high level government officials on board


Established tech executives in your community can be helpful in facilitating introductions to these officials as just getting your foot in the door to pitch to an official at that level can be challenging. In CfA’s earlier years, we relied heavily on the networks of our Board members. Today, government officials who have participated in the program in years past are extremely useful in getting others on board. On a case by case basis, CfA can help to facilitate introductions between mayors in other countries and those in the U.S. who can attest to the value of participating in the fellowship program.

Here are some general tips (more specific tips in a bit) to keep in mind when pitching the fellowship program to high level government officials:

* Identify their biggest pain points (challenges to governing) and suggest different ways that technology plays a role in solving them
* Highlight potential for positive publicity from participating in the program
* Employ a top down sales approach in which you identify and find who is championing a certain goal within the Mayor’s office, and explain to that person that the fellowship is a useful partner to make systems and drive social changes
* Articulate the program as a way to help them achieve top down goals and objectives
* Frame the fellowship as a way to seed a culture virus for innovation that will act as an internal change agent that will sweep through the local government
* Underscore opportunities to increase efficiency, lower costs, enhance civic engagement and foster innovation
* Outline examples of success stories, either from your own work or from similar initiatives. You can find a list of examples of "wins" from CfA programs here and videos showcasing apps and stories from past CfA projects here

As Luke explains: “It's about identifying the goals and outcomes for the city. Often I encourage government partners to help express problems that citizens encounter, I tell them I want them to do some fact-finding to ensure we know there is an issue and where those issues are. I explain that they can use data to pinpoint areas of opportunities, and then nudge them to identify the goals/outcomes.”
