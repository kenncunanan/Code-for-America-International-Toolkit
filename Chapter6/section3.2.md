## Why Won't the Fellows Live in My City?

The fact that fellows partaking in CfA’s fellowship program don’t traditionally live in the cities where they work is oftentimes of concern to government officials. This may or may not be the case for your situation as many partners who have implemented the fellowship have opted for fellows to live in the city where they work. This is oftentimes of concern to local council members who face pressure to keep job opportunities local, prompting officials to anticipate their constituents asking the question “why don’t we hire people in our backyard?”

####Some strategies for addressing this concern:####
* Be very explicit about the residency period of the fellowship and what it entails. Frame it as an important opportunity for in-depth engagement with the city
* Stress the value of having a “traveler’s eye,” a fresh perspective on the city and it’s challenges due to the distance the fellows will naturally have
* Point to the success of CfA’s program - “it’s worked for them for four years in dozens of cities”
* Provide the option of having fellows spend more time than the average 4 visits in their fellowship cities with the option of budgeting in additional resources to cover those incremental travel costs

Alternatively, if this is a dealbreaker for your city partner, it is also worth exploring alternative models in which fellows live in the same cities where they work. For more information on such models, please see here (add link to Mexico City and Code for the Caribbean case studies).
