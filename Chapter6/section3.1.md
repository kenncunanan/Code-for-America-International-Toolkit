For the CfA fellowship program city partners are responsible for contributing 220K towards the total fellowship program cost of 440K. This is a LOT of money for city governments and when pitching the program some start to feel sticker shock. Your own fellowship programs will likely have different costs. Some of you may not

The first order of business is making sure that the potential government partner understands that they are not expectec to bear the burden of the entire cost of the program. Instead, they are paying 220K but receiving a program valued at 440K. It is a 50/50 match program between CfA and the government partner.

####Some strategies for addressing this concern:####
* Acknowledge the validity of their fear and concern
* Be empathetic to their situation
* Emphasize the 50/50 split between CfA and the city partner
* Highlight opportunities for local fundraising to cover the city partner costs of the fellowship
    * Luke shared this framing he uses with government partners about fundraising: “I understand you have resource constraints. Our goal is to make sure we are working in the best, most forward-looking and most strategic ways to find ways to get the project funded in your city.”
* Focus on the potential for impact for both government and citizens and for that impact to occur in a manner that saves the city money
* Discuss the cost of large-scale technology investments that are endemic to most governments and emphasize the value and cost-savings from innovation culture and from the use of lightweight technologies and lean processes

While some variations of the CfA fellowship program have covered all of the costs of the fellowship program in our experience it heightens commitment and enhances programmatic success when the city partner invests (literally) in the program.
