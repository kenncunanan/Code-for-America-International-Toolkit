## <font color="#399fd3">VI. City Engagement</font color>

As with the fellows, Code for America works with U.S. cities  to promote the fellowship program and then receives applications from cities interested in participating in the program. Once the application cycle is complete we then select which cities to work with based upon pre-established selection criteria.

Due to our model, which places teams  of fellows in different cities throughout the U.S., CfA is tasked with galvanizing interest from a multitude of cities interested in participating in the CfA Fellowship Program.

Our City Recruitment strategy has two major prongs:
1. Top of the funnel publication of the program
2. Targeted outreach to potential partners


**Top of the Funnel**

To galvanize interest from a lot of cities CfA engages in various strategies. We publicize the opening of the application process on our website, through our network of government officials.

    5. A few examples of how we approached certain cities in the U.S.


**Targeted Outreach**

A big part of our strategy for getting cities interested in the fellowship program revolves around understanding the needs of city governments in the U.S. and tailoring our discussion of the fellowship program to fit their needs. This has the dual effect of increasing our pool of cities to choose from while simulataneously fostering dialogue around innovation and the role of technology in improving government at the local level.
