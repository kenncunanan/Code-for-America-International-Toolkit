Once CfA has set the stage by publicizing the program among a large audience, CfA begins a process of more targeted outreach. Think of it as dating between CfA Staff and City Partners.

###There are two primary government candidates to target:###


1. **High level city government officials**: City mayors and other high level officials are important to get on board early on because they can pave the way with other city departments who might be interested in collaborating with the fellows. Mayors in the U.S. generally have a pulse for what’s going on on the ground in their cities and have the political capital to get others signed on.

2. **Less senior government officials** (oftentimes from the government IT Department or from the larger government bureaucracy). In our experience, it is more challenging to get these people on board as there is little to gain in terms of political capital but it is risky for them on a professional level to undertake a different approach.





2.. Less senior government officials (oftentimes from the government IT Department or from the larger government bureaucracy). In our experience, it is more challenging to get these people on board as there is little to gain in terms of political capital but it is risky for them on a professional level to undertake a different approach. Generally, staff from the government IT department are resource-constrained and oftentimes see the fellowship program as a way to come in and execute something specific. The emphasis on cultivating and nurturing “emergent outcomes” that come out of the fellowship program are difficult to sell.

Here are some tips for pitching the fellowship program to less senior government officials:

Give them a lot of information and concrete examples from past fellowship programs. More info on CfA’s projects here and here (click on more info about each app and watch the short videos). You can also find illustrative examples of successes in this City Guide on the Fellowship Guidebook, which is a handbook we prepare and distribute to government partners (present and potential).
This will help to counteract resistance to  the emergent nature of the fellowship
Focus efforts on approaching top managers who have decision-making power
Try to get to know them on a personal level and better understand the constraints facing their department, what they’re passionate about and what issues they’d like to work on. Find examples of past projects that could address those issues or brainstorm ideas for future projects that could be effective at leveraging technology to solve that problem
Target outreach efforts to Innovation Officers, Chief Data Officer, and Chief Digital Officers (or their equivalent) if these positions exist in the city where you’d like to implement the fellowship program

For both of these groups it is important to be mindful of the language you use. If you have a technology background do not presuppose a government representative’s degree of technical knowledge. Avoid using terms such as “open source, github issues, API, prototyping, agile development” and other vocab that’s commonplace in the technology world.

Framing is also key. In CfA’s early days we made the mistake of presenting the program as CfA fellows “fixing government.” Alternatively, this opportunity should always be presented as a partnership between two groups that are both passionate about public service and want to make a difference in their communities. The emphasis on collaboration and participatory processes should be established at the very beginning. Using tech-heavy terminology can be isolating, patronizing and, most importantly, derail the potential for collaboration.

invite them to an event, try to connect on a personal level, quick wins!
