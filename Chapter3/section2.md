## <font color="#cf1b41">Key Questions to Consider</font color>

**Here are some questions to ask yourself if you are considering implementing a fellowship style program:**

1. Is there a robust developer community in your community?
2. Would that community be interested in dedicating their time for a year of service
3. Does the government have strict procurement regulations that would make “procuring fellows” (paying a stipend to fellows) difficult?
4. If yes to above, is there a workaround for such difficulty though a formal internship or fellowship program through which the government could pay for fellows?
5. Is there a local government office that is particularly interested in working to find technological solutions to service delivery challenges or to foster civic engagement?

*If you have answered “NO” to any of the questions outlined above you might want to consider other program alternatives before moving forward with a CfA-inspired fellowship program.*
