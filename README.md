This toolkit serves to document the Code for America fellowship program within the U.S. with the hope that it will serve as a helpful reference to support our partners in other countries in the formation of their own programs. The following is a living document serving anyone with the desire to replicate or remix parts of our program for their own purposes. Produced (originally) in collaboration by Code for Allâ€™s Lynn Fine and Alexander Tran, Fellowship Program Manager, with content from the entire civic tech community.
